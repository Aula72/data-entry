section a
question one
i)
ii) object
iii)static variable is one that belongs to a class rather than an object
iv) immutable class is one whose object instances cannot be modified
v) an inner class is one nested within another class
vi)TRUE
vii) an object is an instance of a class
viii) 
ix)
x) - it's name must match the class name
   - it doesn't have return type

question two
i)
ii) wrong
iii) 
iv)Agree
v) static boolean songOfTheYear = touchIt;
vi) a default construct is one that Java creates for any class in case a programmer does not create one, in other words every class has by default has one constructor method
vii) inheritance
viii) instantiation
ix) implements
x) an object from a class

section b
question one
a)
public class FoodItem{
	public Sting name;
	private String displayPriceBoolean{
		//some code here
	}
	//class's construct
	//assuming the construct will always need an argument
	public Fooditem(String name){
		this.name = name; 
	}
}

b)
public class FoodItem{
	public Sting name;
	private String displayPriceBoolean{
		//some code here
	}
	//class's construct
	//assuming the construct will always need an argument
	public Fooditem(String name){
		this.name = name; 
	}
	
}

c)
class Driver{
	
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Fooditem foodItem = new Fooditem("soya"); //this calls the constructor, and initialize the name to soya
		fooditem.displayPrice(true);
	}
	
}
d)image uploaded
e)
private int displayPrice(boolean highPrice, int previousPrice){

}
question three
a) (i) An abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.
(ii) abstract class is accessed using a keyword 'extends' while an interface is accessed using the keyword 'implements'
b) an abstract class cannot be instantiated because it is not a concrete class
c) - when a class is create with a keyword abstract
- when a class contains atleast one abstract method
d) 
class Honda extends Bike{
	public void changeGear(){
		System.out.printIn("Honda gear is changed");
	}
} 
e) No her arguement not right and has a problem because in Java an abstract can not be direct instatiated but to access it, it must be inherited from another class
